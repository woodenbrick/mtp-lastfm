Instead of calling the database for every single track, do one call and cycle through.
If we find a track we dont have then insert.
Currently it takes (with about 1200 tracks):
27 seconds: worst case
16 seconds: best case
delete tracks after they have been scrobbled.
dont check the same mtpdumpfile twice, keep an md5hash of the current one and ignore if it matches
