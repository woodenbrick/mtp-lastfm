h2. MTP-Lastfm

The purpose of this program is to scrobble tracks from mtp devices
(such as the Creative Zen, or the Zune) to last.fm.  You can Love/Ban tracks before scrobbling, and also use the ratings on your device (5=Love, 1=Ban).

If you use Ubuntu, you can add my "PPA repository":https://launchpad.net/~wodemoneke/+archive/ppa to your sources for the latest stable build and to take care of any dependencies.
