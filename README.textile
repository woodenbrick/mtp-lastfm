h2. MTP-Lastfm 0.85

The purpose of this program is to scrobble tracks from mtp devices (such as the Creative Zen, or the Zune) to last.fm.  You can love, ban and tag tracks before scrobbling, and also use the ratings on your device (5=Love, 1=Ban).

A list of compatible players is "now available.":http://mtp-lastfm.appspot.com This list will improve as more people submit their player details to the database. mtp-lastfm will automatically do this after its first run.
