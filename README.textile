h2. MTP-Lastfm 0.82

The purpose of this program is to scrobble tracks from mtp devices (such as the Creative Zen, or the Zune) to last.fm.  You can love, ban and tag tracks before scrobbling, and also use the ratings on your device (5=Love, 1=Ban).

The program can be run from the source directory, or installed using distutils
To run from source: ./mtp-lastfm
Install: python setup.py install (as superuser)
There are also deb packages available from the "PPA repository":https://launchpad.net/~mtp-lastfm/+archive/ppa

Apart from mtp-tools and python-elementtree these should be installed by default on Ubuntu/Debian.
